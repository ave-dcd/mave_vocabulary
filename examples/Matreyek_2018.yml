title: PTEN VAMP-seq
abstract: >-
  Determining the pathogenicity of genetic variants is a critical challenge, and functional assessment is often the 
  only option. Experimentally characterizing millions of possible missense variants in thousands of clinically 
  important genes requires generalizable, scalable assays. We describe variant abundance by massively parallel 
  sequencing (VAMP-seq), which measures the effects of thousands of missense variants of a protein on intracellular 
  abundance simultaneously. We apply VAMP-seq to quantify the abundance of 7,801 single-amino-acid variants of PTEN and 
  TPMT, proteins in which functional variants are clinically actionable. We identify 1,138 PTEN and 777 TPMT variants 
  that result in low protein abundance, and may be pathogenic or alter drug metabolism, respectively. We observe 
  selection for low-abundance PTEN variants in cancer, and show that p.Pro38Ser, which accounts for ~10% of PTEN 
  missense variants in melanoma, functions via a dominant-negative mechanism. Finally, we demonstrate that VAMP-seq is 
  applicable to other genes, highlighting its generalizability.
