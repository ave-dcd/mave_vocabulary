# TODO: update for GA4GH extended model

title: Amyloid-Beta Deep Mutational Scan
abstract: >-
  Multiplexed assays of variant effects (MAVEs) guide clinical variant interpretation and reveal disease mechanisms. To 
  date, MAVEs have focussed on a single mutation type–amino acid (AA) substitutions–despite the diversity of coding 
  variants that cause disease. Here we use Deep Indel Mutagenesis (DIM) to generate a comprehensive atlas of diverse 
  variant effects for a disease protein, the amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide that aggregates in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 
  is mutated in familial AD (fAD). The atlas identifies known fAD mutations and reveals that many variants beyond 
  substitutions accelerate Aβ aggregation and are likely to be pathogenic. Truncations, substitutions, insertions, 
  single- and internal multi-AA deletions differ in their propensity to enhance or impair aggregation, but likely 
  pathogenic variants from all classes are highly enriched in the polar N-terminal region of Aβ. This comparative atlas 
  highlights the importance of including diverse mutation types in MAVEs and provides important mechanistic insights 
  into amyloid nucleation.
